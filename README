NpsfLib
-------
NpsfLib provides a library to solve the Time Dependent Schr√∂dinger Equations (TDSE) for N-Dimensions in several geometries. Based from a skeleton of new simulations and the routines of the library you can develop scientific applications. The project is made by the NPSF Group leaded by Andreas Becker at the MPI PKS.
